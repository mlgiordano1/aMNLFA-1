Notes:

Plots were not very helpful as is. Not sure if I did something wrong...

Was confused by the difference between the 'path' argument and the mrdata argument. Initially thought tht path argument, was the path to the df. Might be best to make sure the description says the directory where the data is. 


two warnings when doing simultaneous
1. No PROPORTION OF DATA PRESENT sections found within COVARIANCE COVERAGE OF DATA output.
^^ I don't know what this warning means but it sounds like my model is bad?

2. Error in str_sub(myVarImpact, 1, 3) : could not find function "str_sub"
this function is from 'stringr' I believe. Need to make sure this package downloads along with amnlfa?
