Description: Automated generation, running, and interpretation of moderated
    nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA) models for obtaining scores from observed
    variables. Models may include latent variable impact (both mean and variance)
    as well as differential item functioning. The aMNLFA package facilitates the
    fitting of these models by interfacing the the Mplus software program.
